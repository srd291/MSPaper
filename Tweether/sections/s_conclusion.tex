\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced Tweether, a visualization tool for displaying the correlation of weather to tweets. Other than making a novel visualization to showcase correlation between weather and sentiment our main goal was to determine if there was any correlation between usage of social media and weather patterns. Using two data sets, we were able to determine that there is some correlation with the amount of tweets related to weather when it is warm in comparison to the colder weather.

Visualizations showcasing social media sentiment has been done many times before, and similarly clustering of weather has been implemented numerous times before. However, there have been few to none works out there which try to find the correlation between the two.

We realized that this work can be expanded to apply to many different scenarios, but we chose to apply it to a question that has been asked for centuries. ...

Our prediction technique worked for...

The line bundling implemented in this visualization is an entity on its own and should be applied to many different works. ...
