\abstract{
As the generation of social media we can instantly express how our day is going; however, unknowingly the weather can play a key role in how we are feeling. The weather dictates our lives regardless of what may be happening. The relationship between weather and mood has been immensely studied to show that the weather does play a major factor regarding to our emotions. However, how much weather affects us and how we display the relationship using social media remain interesting questions. Based on the natural correlation between weather and moods we propose \emph{Tweether}, a real-time weather and tweet visualization, to see how Twitter users are feeling. This visualization displays a current reflection of emotions in a set of select geographic regions and also predicts possible emotions in these regions in response to the weather forecast. The visualization uses multiple layers to show the connection between locations, weather, and emotions. By aggregating multiple users with similar emotions, we create an aesthetic design that is free of visual clutter and is simple to understand in a 3D manner.
